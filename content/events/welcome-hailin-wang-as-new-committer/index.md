Hailin Wang(GitHub ID, hailin0) began his SkyWalking journey since Aug 23rd, 2020.

He is very active on the code contributions and brought several important features into the SkyWalking ecosystem.

He is on the 33rd of the contributor in the main repository[1], focuses on plugin contributions, and logs ecosystem integration, see his code contributions[2].
And also, he started a new and better way to make other open-source projects integrating with SkyWalking.

He used over 2 months to make the SkyWalking agent and its plugins as a part of Apache DolphinScheduler's default binary distribution[3], see this PR[4]. This kind of example has affected further community development. Our PMC member, Yuguang Zhao, is using this way to ship our agent and plugins into the Seata project[5]. With SkyWalking's growing, I would not doubt that this kind of integration would be more.

The SkyWalking accepts him as a new committer.

Welcome Hailin Wang join the committer team.
